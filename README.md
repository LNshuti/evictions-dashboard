# Evictions Dashboard

### Introduction 

### Outline 

##### I. Overview page

##### I.i. Summary of evictions by county.

This should include information on how long people stayed in their homes before being evicted, the number of people evicted from each county, the demographics of those evicted, and any other relevant details. 
  
  
##### II. Map visualizing evictions by county, a timeline visualizing changes in eviction rates over time, and detailed breakdowns by demographic. 


Each page should include elements that help the user navigate the dashboard, such as the page titles and filter options that allow users to customize their view of the data.
