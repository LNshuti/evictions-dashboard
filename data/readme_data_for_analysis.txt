DESCRIPTION:

All datasets in this directory contain counts for eviction filings, households threatened, and eviction judgements that are OBSERVED and VALIDATED. These data are appropriate for multivariate analyses.

OBSERVED: These counts were issued either by the courts or by proprietary data services. This is as opposed to MODELED data. 

Modeled data are appropriate for top-line estimates of the frequency of evictions in locations, but modeled data are not appropriate for multivariate analysis of any kind.

VALIDATED: We validated proprietary data against court-issued data according to the methods set out in our Methods FAQ and Methodological Report. 

- If we determined an observation to have a low count of eviction activity, we removed it from these data. 
- If we are unable to validate an observation, we removed it from these data.

Court-issued data are considered to be self-validating.
